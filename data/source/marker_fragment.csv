thorny excrescences, implying that the CA2/CA3 border is located at the
point of mossy fiber termination. Because mossy fibers contain Zn2  at
high concentration (Frederickson et al., 2000), Timm staining method
may define the border. The technique used in this study has been modified
from Sirvanci et al. (2003). Because zinc must be fixed immediately

cannot be combined with Timm staining. Adult

tested for PV [parvalbumin], CR [calretinin], NK[neurokinin]1 receptor, NPY [neuropeptide Y], and SOM [somatostatin] and was immunonegative
for all of these molecules (data not shown). One section
containing many dendrites of the labeled cell was reacted for
mGluR1a [metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a] and calbindin, and the dendrites were immunonegative
(data not shown). In another section, the dendrites were
shown to be immunopositive for M2 receptor and sparsely contacted
by mGluR7a-positive puncta (Fig. 7D,E), which probably
represent immunopositive nerve terminals innervating the dendrite.
After the immunoreactions, all of the sections were processed
for visualization of neurobiotin by HRP reaction, and the
cell was reconstructed.
The soma was located in the stratum oriens/alveus, and all of
the dendrites remained in this layer including the white matter,
oriented parallel with the layers (Fig. 8a). The dendritic field
covered 930 mmediolaterally and 1500 manteroposteriorly
in the CA1 area and is among the largest fields in our sample of
cells (Fig. 8j). The dendrites were irregularly and sparsely spiny,
with most of the spines of the drumstick-shaped variety (Fig. 8c).
In the CA1 area and subiculum, the axon spanned  3.3 mm in
the rostrocaudal direction. The axon was most dense at the level
of the dendritic field and most widespread in the stratum oriens
passing into the stratum pyramidale. In the vicinity of the cell,
several major axon collaterals reached the border of the stratum
radiatum and lacunosum moleculare, where they turned back
and returned to the stratum oriens. Bouton-bearing collaterals were present in all innervated layers and densest in the stratum
oriens (Fig. 8d,e). Based on the orientation of the soma, the laminar
distribution of the dendrites and the axon, this cell closely
resembled a cell described previously in a similar position and

has also been reported [44].This has lead to the suggestion
that these two classes of neurons may actually belong to only
one class of neurons [60].  This, however, does not seem in
line with observations that whereas many CA1 pyramidal cells
stain positively for calbindin, such cells are virtually absent in
the subiculum.  Moreover, although the two cell types [of pyramidal cells] in the
subiculum cannot be correlated with any distinguishing morphological
characteristic, it has been reported that bursting cells
stain preferentially for somatostatin, whereas the regular spiking
neurons are generally positive for NADPH diaphorase/nitric
