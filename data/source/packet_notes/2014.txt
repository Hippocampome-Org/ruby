Notes: The 03320 class has been mapped into this 03300 class, since they differ only by dendrites in SP.
New rule invoked: when compressing classes, leave axons in PCL because
of the issue of target specificity but discount dendrites.  Therefore, 
this class is now considered 03300 (instead of 03320).

The contrast in some of the figures has been artificially enhanced to 
make them more legible.
