Status:
Active.

Merger status:
Rejected merger with CA1 (-)3300-DG 0110 radiatum- and dentate-
innervating (RADI) neurons (new) due to weakness of D:CA1:SR and A:DG:SMo.
  
Cross-references:
CA1 (-)2333 bistratified-trilaminar (bi-tri) neurons (active)
CA1 (-)3202 perforant path-associated (PPA) neurons (new, proposed for suspension)
