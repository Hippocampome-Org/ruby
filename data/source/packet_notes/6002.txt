Status: active

Merger status:
    No current merger proposals.

Notes:
Likely excitatory cells (Gloveli -> GABA negative, projecting, EP characteristics similar to principal cells; van Haeften -> spiny; Canto & Witter -> projecting, "principal," sparsely spiny).

The van Haeften et al. paper does not include mention of projection to Sub or DG.  Possibly lost to slicing or possibly outside the scope of their interest.

While this morphology appears in Canto's 201X MEC preprint, there is no mention of this morphology in the LEC preprint.
