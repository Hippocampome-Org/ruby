Merger status:
    Merger with CA1 2223 axo-axonic cells REVOKED due to the issue of
        target specificity.  Axo-axonic cells exclusively target 
        pyramidal cells while basket cells are also known to target
        other interneurons.

Notes:
Other classes of CA1 basket cells:
- basket 0012 cells are in the 0012 PTI packet
- basket 2113 neurons mentioned by Fuentealba (2010) are n=1
- basket PV wide-arbour neurons mentioned by Pawelzik (2002) are considered ivy-like cells and are included in the 0333 packet
- basket 0232 neurons mentioned by Freund & Buzsaki (1996) likely also 
have dendritic invasion in SLM (evidence based on Pawelzik (2002), 
meaning they are really basket 2232

Hippocampome rules enacted:
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection ii, Clause 3 - perisomatic axonal targeting interpreted as PCL
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection iii, Clause 1 - extended interpretation of SP in apical and basal directions
