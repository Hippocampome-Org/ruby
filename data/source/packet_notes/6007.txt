Status: Active 

Merger status: None being considered
   
Notes:  This cell type was approved when it was in a packet with a total of three references.  Its patterning has not changed.  The packet had to be split because this cell is excitatory and the other two are inhibitory.  The other two cells are in the pyramid-looking III packet.
