Status: active

Merger status:
- Merger REVOKED between CA1 (-)0012 axo-axonic and CA1 0012 basket cells due to target specificity.  Axo-axonic cells exclusively target pyramidal cells; basket cells also target interneurons.

- The Zemankovics CA1 (-)0012 FS PTI cells are merged into this packet even though the authors could not distinguish between axo-axonic and basket cells

Notes:
Target soma and proximal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and other interneurons.

Hippocampome rules enacted:
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection ii, Clause 3 - perisomatic axonal targeting interpreted as PCL
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection iii, Clause 1 - extended interpretation of SP in apical and basal directions
