Status:
Active.

Merger status:
This packet is a merger of CA1 (-)0102 IS-I and CA1 (-)0112 IS-I

Previous merger of CA1 (-)0102 IS-I with CA1 0103 O-R (aka oriens-bistratified) was rejected due to the lack of axonal evidence in SO.  Namely, even with six consecutive 80 ľm sections, axons were not significantly present.

Notes:
Packet now uses original (Gulyás) evidence rather than the Freund & Buzsáki review.

According to Gulyás, the CR interneurons in this packet innervate mostly if not exclusively other GABAergic neurons via multiple synapses
