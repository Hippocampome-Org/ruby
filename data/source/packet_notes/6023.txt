Status: active

Merger status:
Rejected merger with LEC (+)113330 multipolar neurons 1 III (MPN 1 III), since these cells have "no main apical dendrite traveling up to the pia" and, for MPN 1 III, "Within LI the diameter of the apical dendritic tree can be up to 400 microm." 

Notes:
Likely excitatory cells (Canto 201X MEC preprint -> "principal," spiny to sparsely spiny).
