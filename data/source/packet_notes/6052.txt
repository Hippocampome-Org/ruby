Status: Active

Merger status:
    This packet is a result of a merger between MEC 000023 pyramidal VI
    and EC 000023 polymorphic V.

Notes:
Likely excitatory cells (Canto 201X MEC preprint -> "sparsely spiny to spiny," projecting; Hamam 2000 -> short spines, projecting).

Notes on MEC 000023 pyramidal packet:
- dendrites and axons in the white matter

Notes on EC 000023 polymorphic packet:
- weak evidence on axons
- unclear whether dendrites project to the subiculum or to the presubiculum.  The packet was previously approved by D, C, C, and G with dendritic presence in Sub:SP, but Charise pointed out that because of the position of the cell relative to the angular bundle, the projection could be to the presubiculum.  Notes have been added.
