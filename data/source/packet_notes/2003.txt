Single reference packet, but n = 7 out of 10.

Merger status:
No mergers currently proposed

Notes:
Alexander has yet to establish specific tresholds for EP parameters to
be used in determining whether a cell calss is excitatory or inhibitory.
However, he has looked at this particular case and believes that this
class is excitatory. As our resident expert, his opinion is good enough
for us to make that call at this point.  (see packet pg.3.)

The authors do note speculate as to whether the cells are E or I, choosing
instead to remark that the class has properties of both.

There is also a CA3 22011 RGC packet in suspended animation (n=3).
Ca1 2201 RGCs also exist and are known to be excitatory.

This packet contains citations from Savic & Sciancalepore, 2001.
