Merger status:
    Merger approved CA3 22223 basket cells REVOKED due to the issue of
         target specificity.  Axo-axonic cells exclusively target 
         pyramidal cells while basket cells are known to also target
         other interneurons.

Notes:
Synapse exclusively with AIS of pyramidal cells

Gulyas et al. 1993 is in guinea pigs

Hippocampome rules enacted:
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection ii, Clause 3 - perisomatic axonal targeting interpreted as PCL
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection iii, Clause 1 - extended interpretation of SP in apical and basal directions
