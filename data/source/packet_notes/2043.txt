Merger status:
    Merger with CA3 22223 axo-axonic cells REVOKED due to the issue of
         target specificity.  Axo-axonic cells exclusively target 
         pyramidal cells while basket cells are known to also target
         other interneurons.

Notes:
Hippocampome rules enacted:
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection ii, Clause 3 - perisomatic axonal targeting interpreted as PCL
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection iii, Clause 1 - extended interpretation of SP in apical and basal directions
