Status: Active

Merger status:
This class is composed of an amalgam of author-defined classes.
Failed unofficial merger proposals with MEC 331111 stellate II, EC 231000 FOMP, and EC 221100 oblique pyramidal-stellate II.

Notes:
Sparsely spiny to spiny, projecting -> excitatory.

Packet was previously approved by all, including GAA.  Since then, the horizontal neuron from the Canto LEC preprint has been added.  It was previously in (-)331000, but that cell should not have been classified as inhibitory.  Note that the (-)331000 packet no longer exists because no axonal information remains; the leftovers from that packet have become (-)220000, which is suspended.

The figure of the between pyramidal and stellate cell depicts an axon that dies off in L:VI, which is not substantial enough for an A:VI interpretation. - DWW

C&W's LEC description of a pyramidal cell matches 331000.  They also describe a second class (333000) that is n=2 (by itself an insufficient percentage to establish a separate class).  However, since the 333000 class does exist, this evidence is included in that packet. - DWW

The Canto MEC pyramidal neuron from Figure 5 was added, even though it has borderline dendrites in VI.
