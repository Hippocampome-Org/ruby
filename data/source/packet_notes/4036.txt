Status: active

Merger status:
    Merger with CA1 2223 basket cells REVOKED due to the issue of target
        specificity.  Axo-axonic cells exclusively target pyramidal cells
        while basket cells are also known to target other interneurons.

Notes:
Exclusive innervation of pyramidal cells; axo-axonic cells do NOT connect with other interneurons

Hippocampome rules enacted:
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection ii, Clause 3 - perisomatic axonal targeting interpreted as PCL
- Rule 4, Section 3, Subsection iii, Clause 1 - extended interpretation of SP in apical and basal directions
