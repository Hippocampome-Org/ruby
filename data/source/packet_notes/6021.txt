Merger status:
    No current merger proposals
    Merger with 220233 was rejected.

Notes:
Likely excitatory cells (Hamam 2000 -> spiny; Hamam 2002 -> projecting, spiny; Canto 2008 -> spiny, projecting; Canto 201X MEC preprint -> projecting, "principal," sparsely spiny).

Canto & Witter 2008 schematic remains in this packet because the authors cite Hamam in the text.  Evidence for D:IV in this schematic is minimal to threshold.
