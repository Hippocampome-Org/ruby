Notes:  The articles in this packet were part of the old MFA 03332p packet.  That packet has been split into this packet and the 03330p packet.  

Borderline:  some axonal presence in SO and SR

Axons have not been counted in SR for this cell, despite the personal communication from Dr Soltesz suggesting that MFA's make synapses with the dendrites of CA3 granule cells in SR, because the cells identified in the Soltesz work show the 03330p pattern.
