Status: active

Merger status:
Failed unofficial merger proposal with 002331 globular IV/V because evidence in that packet is too weak.

Notes:
Likely excitatory cells (Canto & Witter 201X MEC preprint -> projecting, spiny to sparsely spiny, "principal").

Packet formerly included only the Canto MEC multipolar neuron (pg 3, rightmost cell).  Packet now also includes horizontally tilted pyramidal neuron (same page, second cell from right).  Now, clearly, n > 1.
