Notes: The 03331 and 03301 classes have been mapped into this 03311 class,
since they differ only by axons and dendrites in SP.

New rule invoked: when compressing classes, leave axons in PCL because
of the issue of target specificity but discount dendrites.  Therefore, 
this class is now considered 03311 (instead of 03331).

The contrast in some of the figures has been artificially enhanced to 
make them more legible.
