The axons of O-LM cells give few collaterals in stratum oriens but project mainly through the strata pyramidale and radiatum to branch heavily in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Ramon y Cajal, 1893; McBain et al.,1994; Sik et al., 1995; Maccaferri & McBain, 1996), matching the glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex and thalamus.  The axons give some collaterals also in the deep stratum radiatum but do not cross the fissure to the dentate gyrus (Fig. 2F).  The main glutamatergic input to O-LM cells arises from local CA1 pyramidal cells (Blasco-Ibanez & Freund, 1995) and O-LM cells in turn project to the apical tuft of CA1 pyramidal cells and other interneurons (Katona et al., 1999a; Maccaferri et al., 2000).","p948, left mid","CA1 1002 O-LM cells [Y:CA1:O-LM:S:CA1:SO]{#3},

This is remarkable because the apical tuft of pyramidal cells in stratum lacunosum-moleculare, receiving excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex and thalamus, has not been a major subject of investigation in connection to sharp wave-associated ripples.  Ripples in the CA1 area are generated by strong excitatory input from CA3 pyramidal cells innervating the basal and oblique CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites in strata oriens and radiatum (Csicsvari et al., 2000).  The activity of layer 3 principal cells in the entorhinal cortex projecting to CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare during ripple oscillations in the CA1 hippocampus has not yet been determined.","p953, left bot","CA1 (+)2223p-SUB 111-EC 000011 pyramidal cell (PC)

Iucidum, immediately above the cell body layer, which  corresponds to the projection of the mossy fibers from the DG (for further details on connectivity see chapter ""Connectivity of the Hippocampus"").

Intracellular dye injection studies in vivo and in vitro also reported axon collaterals in SO and not in SR (Ishizuka et al., 1990, 1995).

In  this study, some CA2 pyramids had axons arborizing in SO and SR of CA1, CA2, and CA3, but the majority, like CA1 pyramidal axons, arborized exclusively in SO.

A relatively homogenous group of 16 clearly nonpyramidal neurons was recovered near the stratum radiatum border.  Most of these cells had fusiform multipolar somata (~p20 microm in diameter, their Fig. 3), and extended mainly smooth, beaded dendrites through two-thirds of CA1.  Axons, reconstructed in five neurons, started from a primary dendrite in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, and projected through the stratum radiatum, along the stratum pyramidale, and occasionally into the stratum oriens.  In two interneurons, axon collaterals were not restricted to CA1, but crossed the hippocampal fissure into the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.  While recognizing the still undetermined role of L-M interneurons in  hippocampal circuitry, this study suggested a feedforward inhibitory function based on their strong excitation by major extrinsic afferents, and the presence in this layer of immunoreactivity for GABA (Gamrani et al., 1986) and its synthesizing enzyme (Somogyi et al., 1984; Kunkel et al., 1986).

338,MR,,MR,510078,SUB (+)331p-CA1 1110 pyramidal cells-CA1 projecting (PC-CA1),"""Evidence for subicular inputs to CA1 has appeared in several previous anatomical studies.  Berger et al. [5] [1980] examined the anterograde and retrograde transport of HRP [horseradish peroxidase] in rabbit brains.  They found that injections into the CA1 cell layer (including the proximal apical and basal dendrites) resulted in anterograde (CA1 to subiculum) label and retrograde (subiculum to CA1) label in subiculum.  Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2).  Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections.  One of these cells had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1.  Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs.  Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare.  It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1.  It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites.  On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer.  We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer.  Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.""","p48, left top","SUB (+)331p-CA1 1110 pyramidal cells-CA1 projecting (PC-CA1)

A diagram of the dentate gyrus and proximal portion of the hippocampus to summarize the major synaptic relationships of the [granule cell] mossy fibers.  Granule cells (marked 1 and 2) give rise to extensive collateral plexuses that are distributed throughout much of the hilus.  These collaterals have two types of synaptic varicosities (several of the larger varicosities are enclosed within circles) that terminate on cells of the hilar region.  Some of these varicosities contact the basal dendrites of pyramidal basket cells (3) which give rise to the GABA[gamma aminobutyric acid]ergic basket plexus that terminates on the somata and proximal dendrites of the granule cells (black arrows); this serves as an inhibitory feedback circuit.  Other collateral varicosities terminate on the mossy cells (4) of the hilar region that give rise to the associational and commissural afferents to the dentate gyrus that terminate in the inner third of the molecular layer (arrowheads); these connections serve as an excitatory feedback circuit.  While it is likely that the mossy fiber collaterals terminate on many other types of hilar neurons, these relationships have not yet been experimentally demonstrated.  As the parent mossy fiber approaches the pyramidal cell layer, the large presynaptic expansions begin to appear (some are enclosed in squares) and are found approximately 140 microm apart for the entire length of the axon.  These expansions form complex synapses with the specialized spines (thorny excresences) on the apical and basal dendrites of the pyramidal cells (5).  A few collaterals usually  arise from the mossy fibers in the proximal part of the pyramidal cell layer (open arrows) and terminate in the hilar region of the infra-, or more commonly, the suprapyramidal blade; these collaterals often have a large expansion in the hilar region.

Our methodological combination of retrograde tracing and intracellular injection allows the use of several techniques to be applied to the same material in order to establish various features of identified neurons.  Thus, it was possible to determine that at least some of the sparsely spinous projection neurons use GABA as transmitter (Germroth et al., '89a), and that some (if not most) of the hippocampally projecting stellate   cells mediate olfactory input to the hippocampus (Schwerdtfeger et al., '90).

Two types of neurons were  distinguished on the basis of soma location, the characteristics of the dendritic tree, and the axon arborisation pattern. Type I cells were located in stratum radiatum of the CA1 and CA3 regions and occasionally in strata pyramidale and oriens. These cells had multipolar or bitufted dendritic trees primarily located in stratum radiatum. Their axons could be followed for a considerable distance, arborised within stratum radiatum, and were covered with regularly spaced small boutons.","p525, abstract ","CA3 (-) 03000 radiatum-calbindin (R-CB) neurons

This distinction has been confirmed and extended in the present study by the visualisation of the axons of some of these CB-IR cells. Type I cells (Figs. IAB, 2) were most numerous in stratum radiatum of the CA3 and CA1 regions but could be found in strata pyramidale and oriens as well. These cells were multipolar or bitufted with two to five primary dendrites running in all directions, often descending to stratum oriens, but only occasionally entering  stratum lacunosum-moleculare. There was a large variation in the horizontal span of the dendritic trees. The dendrites of most cells, primarily of the bitufied  type, had a relatively small horizontal extent.  However, some cells of multipolar morphology (see cells 2, 4 in Fig. 2A and cell 3 in 2B), had rather long, arch-like dendrites running horizontally for a considerable distance (400-500 microm). Axons originated from the soma (cell 1 in Fig. 2A, cells 1, 4 in Fig. 2B)  or from a primary  dendrite  (cells 2-4 in Fig. 2A, cells 2, 3 in Fig. 2B) near the soma.","p526, right bot","CA3 (-) 03000 radiatum-calbindin (R-CB) neurons

All the multiform cells had dendrites that extended over layers I, II, and deep into layer III.  The aspect of one of the multiform cells was very similar to that of the stellate cells from MEC [medial entorhinal cortex] layer II, with an ascending and a descending arbor that extended widely over layers I-II and II-III, respectively (Fig. 10).  The physiology of this cell, however, was very different from that of the stellate cells in that it lacked time-dependent rectification (see below), which is a salient characteristic of the medial EC [entorhinal cortex] stellate cells.  The dendrites of all multiform cells were also sparsely covered with spines.  The axon could be traced down to the white matter in two cases.""","p128, left top","ED 333000p-DG 1000-SUB 111 excitatory neurons

The apical dendritic arbor can reach its maximum diameter of up to 400 microm already in LIII, in contrast to the small spiny  pyramidal apical dendritic tree that maximizes its diameter in LI.  The spiny basal dendritic tree has a diameter of about 400 microm.  The basal dendrites of complex pyramidal neurons are generally confined to LIII, rarely reaching LV (N = 3).  The main axon of complex pyramidal neurons travels towards the angular bundle and sometimes into the subiculum.  Many local collaterals are formed that spread within LIII and the lamina dissecans.  Other collaterals travel via deep MEC [medial entorhinal cortex] layers towards very superficial  LI.

This latter cell type is a projection neuron whose soma is located in the stratum radiatum, that possesses dendritic morphology quite similar to CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and is a subset of the previously described class of neurons termed radiatum giant cells (RGCs) (Maccaferri and McBain, 1996; Gulyas et al., 1998; Savic and Sciancalepore, 2001).  The main feature distinguishing PLPs from RGCs is the pyramidal neuron-like single apical dendrite that bifurcates at distances >50 microm from a pyramidally shaped soma; in contrast, RGCs typically possess two apical dendrites emanating from an inverted pyramid or shield-shaped soma.  An intriguing feature of PLPs is that, although having an apical dendritic morphology similar to CA1 pyramidal neurons, their somatodendritic distribution of I(sub)h is reversed compared with that of CA1 pyramidal cells, with a high density of I(sub)h at the soma but low I(sub)h density in the dendrites that declines with increasing distance from the soma (Bullis et al., 2004).""","p7996, right mid","CA1 2201 PLP-RG cells [Y:CA1:PLP:S:CA1:SR]{#3}

The axo-axonic cell is named for the fact that its axon descends from the molecular layer into  the granule cell layer, collateralizes profusely, and then terminates, with symmetrical synaptic contacts, exclusively on the axon initial segments of  granule cells.  Thus, their shape resembles that of a chandelier.  Each axo-axonic cell may innervate the axon initial segments of as many as 1000 granule cells.  Because these cells are immunoreactive for markers of GABA[gamma-aminobutyric acid]ergic neurons and make symmetrical synapses, it is likely that they provide a second means of inhibitory control of granule cell output.

Because in the rat this projection originates in both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the hippocampus, it has been called the associational/commissural projection.  This projection was initially thought to arise from both the cells of the polymorphic layer and the CA3 pyramidal cells located within the confines of the dentate  gyrus. If this were true, it would mean that at least one of the intrinsic hippocampal connections would be bidirectional.  It is now clear, however, that the associational/commissural  projection arises exclusively from cells in the polymorphic layer, and CA3 cells do not project to the molecular layer.

In the proximal portion of CA3, mossy fibers are also located below and within the pyramidal cell layer. The layer of mossy fiber termination located just above the pyramidal cell layer is called the stratum lucidum because the lack of myelin on the mossy fibers gives the layer a relatively clear appearance in fresh tissue  (as one might visualize in a hippocampal slice experiment).  There is no indication that dentate neurons other than the granule cells project  to CA3; in particular, cells in the polymorphic layer do not project to the hippocampus, at least in the rodent.

In fact, each CA3 pyramidal cell gives rise to highly collateralized axons that follow both transverse and oblique orientations through  CA1 (Ishizuka  et al., 1990). Although Schaffer collaterals are typically illustrated as extending only through the stratum radiatum, it should be emphasized that both the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens of CA1 are heavily innervated by CA3 axons.  Thus, the Schaffer collaterals are as highly associated with the apical dendrites of CAI cells in the stratum radiatum as they  are with the basal dendrites in the stratum oriens.

The cell bodies are located within or immediately adjacent to the pyramidal cell layer and possess radially oriented dendrites spanning all layers (Fig. 2).  The dendrites are smooth, often varicose, and spines are only rarely present on a few branches.  Three to six main dendritic trunks extend toward the hippocampal fissure, emitting few if any side branches in stratum radiatum.  In stratum lacunosum-moleculare however, they form a tuft of fine, slender processes (Li et al., 1992; Gulyis et al., 1993a; Buhl et al., 1994b).  There is a rich arbor of basal dendrites in stratum oriens, which extends up to, or occasionally penetrates, the alveus.  Thus, according to the distribution of the dendritic tree, chandelier cells are in a position to receive excitatory input from all major sources of afferents in both the CA1 and CA3 subfields, with some preference for the perforant path input.  The column occupied by the dendrites has a diameter of 200-300 microm.  The axon, which originates from the soma or a primary dendrite, forms a dense arbor in strata pyramidale and proximal oriens and consists of vertical or oblique rows of boutons (Figs. 2, 3).  The only axo-axonic cell with a complete axonal and dendritic tree intracellularly labeled in vivo was described by Li et al. (1992).  They reported an axon arbor occupying an elliptical area of 600 by 850 microm, elongated in the septotemporal direction, within which 40-50-microm groupings of terminal segments could be observed in some sections.  Three chandelier cells filled in the CA3 subfield of 400-microm-thick slices in the guinea pig had a transverse axonal spread of 800 microm, 1,300 microm, and 1,700 microm (Gulyas et al., 1993a), whereas one reported in CA1 extended for 950 microm (Buhl et al., 1994b).  Each of these cells had axon collaterals in all sections cut from the 400-microm slice.

Unlike in the cerebellum, axons of individual basket cells do not form typical baskets around the somata of their target cells; they only contribute to the pericellular array of boutons.  The transverse extent of the axon of an intracellularly injected basket cell (within a 400-microm-thick slice) was estimated to be 900 microm; the density of bouton-laden collaterals within this arbor is extremely high (Han et al., 1993).  A basket cell intracellularly recorded and filled in the dentate hilus in vivo had an axon arbor that covered the entire suprapyramidal blade (longer than 1 mm transverse spread) and extended more than 1.5 mm along the septotemporal axis (Sik et al., submitted).

The first descriptions of bistratified and horizontal trilaminar cells were given by Buhl et al. (1994a) and Sik et al. (1995).  Cell bodies of these neurons are localized within or near to stratum pyramidale or at the stratum oriens-alveus border (Fig. 12).  The dendritic trees of bistratified cells are spine free, often varicose, and multipolar.  Several primary dendrites bifurcate close to the soma.  These dendrites have a predominantly radial orientation but frequently also emit horizontal branches.  In contrast with the dendritic tree of basket and chandelier cells, the vertical branches of bistratified cells do not reach stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Miles et al., 1996; Halasy et al., 1996).  The dendrites of the horizontal trilaminar cell run horizontally at the stratum oriens-alveus border, extending over several hundred micrometers in the septotemporal and transverse directions.  This cell has a large soma, with prominent primary dendrites, and occasional spines on more distal segments (Sik et al., 1995).  Radial trilaminar cells [in CA1] are very similar to bistratified cells with regard to their axonal and dendritic trees, but there are also some consistent differences.  In contrast with bistratified cells, dendrites of radial trilaminar cells often penetrate stratum lacunosum-moleculare (A.I. Gulyas and R. Miles, unpublished observations).  This is especially true for those cells located in distal stratum radiatum (i.e., portion of stratum radiatum closer to stratum lacunosum-moleculare).  The axon of bistratified cells forms a dense arbor of fine varicose collaterals both above and below the pyramidal cell layer, occupying the entire width of stratum oriens and a zone of 200-300 microm of ""proximal"" stratum radiatum (i.e., toward the pyramidal cell layer) in the CA1 and CA3 regions (Buhl et al., 1994a; Sik et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996).""","p369, right mid","CA1 (-)0333 bistratified cells-ivy (BiC-ivy)

Summary diagram of the morphological classification scheme.  Interneuron types are identitied according to dendritic and axonal arborization patterns in the hippocampus (top) and in the dentate gyrus (bottom).  Filled circles mark the cell body location.  The cell bodies give rise to thick horizontal and/or vertical lines indicating the predominant orientation and laminar distribution of the dendritic tree.  The hatched boxes cover those laminae where the axon of each interneuron typically arborizes.  The transverse extension of the axons or dendrites are not indicated.  Principal cells in the background provide an idea of which membrane domains (somatic, proximal, or distal dendritic regions) are innervated by the different interneuron types.  The laminar distribution of different excitatory afferents (indicated on the right margin) often shows a perfect match with that of the axon arbor of an interneuron type.""

Therefore we initially grouped our recorded neurons accordingly.  However, our results do not show striking differences in either morphological (Fig. 9B) or electrophysiological properties (Fig. 9C).  Pyramidal neurons (N = 14; preweaned N = 8, postweaned N = 6) have spiny to sparsely spiny apical dendrites that split frequently in all superficial layers and can reach a diameter of 500 microm as measured in a plane parallel to the pia.  The spiny basal dendritic tree has a multipolar organization with an overall diameter of around 500 microm, forming the majority of branches within LV, occasionally reaching LIII [layer III] (N = 6)  and  LVI [layer VI] (Figs. 9A, B; N = 8).  There are also bipolar pyramidal neurons with one prominent spiny apical dendrite and one spiny basal dendrite that travels more in the horizontal direction parallel to the borders with the other layers (Fig. 9A; N = 4; preweaned N = 3, postweaned N = 1), reaching a diameter of up to 400 microm.  LV pyramidal neurons have a major axon reaching the white matter with collaterals branching off in LV, reaching a diameter of up to 900 microm within LV, frequently reaching LIII-LVI, quite often LII [layer II], and occasionally LI [layer I] in the proximity of the apical dendrite.""","p1265, right bot","EC (+)223331 horizontal-bipolar-pyramidal (HOBIPPY)

The remaining 60% of the [dentate] hilar mossy cell axons target GABA[gamma amino butyrica acid]-positive cells (Buckmaster et al. 1996; Wenzel et al. 1997), with no reports supporting mossy cell targeting of IS [interneuron selective] cells.  Assuming that there is no preferential target selectivity between HIPP [hilar cells with axonal projections to the perforant path] and HICAP [hilar cells with axonal projections to the commissural-associational pathway] cells, and that each postsynaptic hilar interneuron receives two synaptic contacts from a single mossy cell axon (Buckmaster et al. 1996), we estimated that each mossy cell contacted 600 HIPP and 200 HICAP cells. With very low mossy cell to interneuron connectivity in the inner molecular layer (Wenzel et al. 1997), we estimated that each mossy cells contacts five to ten basket and axo-axonic cells and nearly five MOPP [molecular layer cells with axonal projections to the perforant path] cells with somata in the inner molecular layer (Han et al. 1993).""","p1581, left mid","DG (+)0103 mossy cells (MC)

Assuming a single synapse per postsynaptic cell, a single mossy cell is estimated to contact 30,000-35,000 GCs [granule cell]. Of the 2700 synapses made by a single MC [mossy cell] axon in the hilus, approximately 40% target GABA [gamma-aminobutyric acid]-negative neurons (Wenzel et al.,1997).  As each mossy cell is estimated to make 1-5 synaptic contacts on a single postsynaptic mossy cell (Buckmaster et al.,1996), it is estimated that each mossy cell contacts approximately 350 other MCs (this is likely to be a generous estimate since it is based on the assumption that all GAD [glutamic acid decarboxylase] negative somata in the hilus represent MCs). The remaining 60% of the hilar mossy cell axons target GABA [gamma-aminobutyric acid]-positive cells (Buckmaster et al., 1996; Wenzel et al.,1997), with no reports demonstrating mossy cell synapses onto IS [interneuron specific] cells.  Assuming that there is no preferential target selectivity between HIPP [hilar perforant path-associated] and HICAP [hilar commissural-associational pathway related] cells and that each postsynaptic hilar interneuron receives two synaptic contacts from a single mossy cell axon (Buckmaster et al.,1996), each mossy cell is estimated to contact 600 HIPP and 200 HICAP cells.  There is very low mossy cell to interneuron connectivity in the inner molecular layer (Wenzel et al.,1997); MC[mossy cell]s could contact 5-10 basket and axo-axonic cells and approximately 5 MOPP [molecular layer perforant path-associated] cells with somata in the inner molecular layer (Han et al.,1993).

Most of the interneuron types arborizing in stratum radiatum show a profuse axonal network close to their soma with regularly spaced boutons along the collaterals and  innervate dendrites of pyramidal cells [Buhl 1994, Gulyas 1993, Lacaille 1988].  In contrast, VIP-containing cells with stratum radiatum projection have a highly variable interbouton distance.  This means that long axonal segments with hardly any varicosities alternate with strings of closely  spaced boutons, which occasionally form pericellular arrays as well in stratum radiatum around unlabelled perikarya.""","p312, right bot","CA1 (-)2300 stratum radiatum-targeting interneuron specific-1 (SR IS-1) neurons

The characteristic feature of these neurons is their axonal projection terminating in the outer molecular layer in  a  particular  vertically  oriented  fashion (Fig. 8B). The main axon emerges from either the soma or one of the primary dendrites (Fig. 8B). Shortly after leaving the soma, the axon gives off several very long axonal collaterals ( < 900 microm) [less than or equal to 900 microm]. One population then takes a more or lessvertical course passing through the granule cell layer, the inner molecular layer,  and finally terminating  within  the outer  molecular  layer.  Within  the  inner  molecular  layer, some of these collaterals give rise to tangentially oriented side branches of variable length (30-300 microm) that also terminate within the outer molecular layer.  On  their  way through the granule cell layer, these vertically oriented axonal collaterals form basket-like bouton arrays around granule cell somata. A second population of collaterals establishes a sometimes dense axonal plexus within the hilus, with en passant boutons contacting somata of other hilar neurons. Some  of  these  collaterals  were  seen to project to CA3c (Fig. 8B).""","p1526, left bot","DG (-)1333p-CA3 01111 hilar interneurons with collaterals in all layers (HICALs)

The thick varicose dendrites of this cell type were few and seldom branched.  These dendrites coursed horizontally, often for several hundred micrometers within st. oriens and alveus, but never crossed into st. pyramidale or st. radiatum.  These interneurons correspond to superior zone cells originally described by Ramon y Cajal (1968).  We were able to characterize the axons of 14 of these cells.  Surprisingly, the axons of these cells crossed st. pyramidale and ran through radiatum to st. lacunosum, where they formed a highly branching plexus, covering an area of several hundred micrometers within st. lacunosum.  This morphology matches that of somatostatin-containing cells of st. oriens (Naus et al., 1988; Schwartzkroin et al., 1990;  Baude et  al.,  1993).

Axons from any particular septotemporal point in the dentate gyrus may innervate as much as 75% of the long axis of the dentate gyrus (Amaral and Witter, 1989).  Second, the projection to the molecular layer at the septotemporal level of origin is very weak, but gets increasingly stronger at levels that are progressively more distant from the cells of origin. Remembering that mossy cells are the recipients of massive innervation from the granule cells at their same level (via the mossy fiber collaterals into the polymorphic layer), it would appear that the mossy cells pass on the collective output of granule cells from one septotemporal level to granule cells located at distant levels of the dentate gyrus.""","p14, right top","DG 0103 mossy cells
